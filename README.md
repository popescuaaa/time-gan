# Task agnostic sequence generation (Thesis)
Based on: [TimeGAN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf)


1. Pytorch implementation of the [TimeGAN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf)
   - [x] train helpers
   - [x] dataset (from RCGAN)
   - [x] test models integrity
   - [x] main entry for time_gan
    
   1.1. Visualization:
    - [x] tsne 
    
   1.2 Metrics
    - [ ] discriminative metric
    
2. Datasets
   - [x]  get datasets for rc_gan - not good
   - [ ] energy 
   - [ ] stocks
    
3. Written material
   - [ ] document rc_gan + its performance on all datasets
   - [ ] all bibliography
   - [ ] introduction + mathematical context
   - [ ] usability scenarios
