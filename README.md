# Task agnostic sequence generation (Thesis)
Based on: [TimeGAN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf)


1. Pytorch implementation of the [TimeGAN](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf)
   - [ ] train helpers
   - [ ] dataset (from RCGAN)
   - [ ] test model integrity
   - [ ] main entry for time_gan
    
   1.1. Visualization:
    - [ ] notebook with pretrained model
    
   1.2 Metrics
    - [ ] discriminative metric
    
2. Datasets
   - [ ]  get datasets for rc_gan
    
3. Written material
   - [ ] document rc_gan + its performance on all datasets
   - [ ] all bibliography
   - [ ] introduction + mathematical context
   - [ ] usability scenarios
